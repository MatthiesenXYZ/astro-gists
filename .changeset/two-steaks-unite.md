Full Shiki theme support with options to have light/dark mode! Now creating our own expressive code engine from the core module instead of the expressive-code package

## Breaking Changes:

- User Config `theme` changed to `themes` will accept an array `['github-light','github-dark']` or a string `'github-dark'`
