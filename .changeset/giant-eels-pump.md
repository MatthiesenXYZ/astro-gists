"@matthiesenxyz/astro-gists": patch
---

Changes:
- Internal refactor that will provide better future-proofing, this change also allowed the addition of EC's built in light/dark mode automations!  Code Blocks will now be able to show both dark/light mode depending on the user's system preferences.

# NEW:
- adds light/darkmode support
- Themes can be defined by either single theme or an array (`['astroGists-dark','astroGists-light']`)
